1. **Inventory Optimization**: Electronics retail typically ties up 60-70% of capital in inventory. Consider:
   - Reduce slow-moving inventory by 30% 
   - Focus on fast-moving items (smartphones, accessories)
   - Negotiate 30-day payment terms with suppliers

2. **Revenue Acceleration**: 
   - Offer 5% discounts for immediate payment
   - Consider EMI options for high-value items
   - Bundle accessories to increase average transaction value

3. **Seasonal Planning**: Electronics sales peak during festivals - prepare cash for September-November inventory buildup.

Expected Impact: ₹50,000-75,000 monthly cash flow improvement."`);

**Previous Recommendations Status Check**:
- Have you implemented the 30% inventory reduction we discussed?
- Are you seeing results from the EMI payment options?

**Enhanced Strategy Based on Your ₹5,00,000 Revenue**:
1. **Advanced Inventory Management**: 
   - Implement just-in-time ordering for non-seasonal items
   - Use your sales data to predict demand patterns
   - Consider dropshipping for low-margin accessories

2. **Cash Flow Acceleration**:
   - Introduce customer loyalty programs with immediate benefits
   - Negotiate better credit terms based on your consistent revenue
   - Consider invoice factoring for B2B sales

**AI-Detected Pattern**: Your revenue indicates healthy business fundamentals. Cash flow issues are likely operational, not structural.

Next Steps: Focus on working capital optimization rather than revenue generation."`);
